# TLVFlow

A vehicle-sharing management system for Tel Aviv, built as a RESTful API.
Users can register, rent bikes, e-bikes and scooters from docking stations across the city, and return them to any station with available capacity.
The system handles the full ride lifecycle including payments, vehicle maintenance, degradation reporting, and persistent state across restarts.

## Features

- **User management** — registration with hashed passwords (PBKDF2-SHA256), email uniqueness enforcement, and upgrade path from regular to Pro accounts.
- **Ride lifecycle** — start a ride from the nearest station with an eligible vehicle, end at the nearest station with capacity, automatic fee calculation and payment processing.
- **Three vehicle types** — Bikes, E-Bikes, and Scooters with type-specific maintenance treatments and rental eligibility rules.
- **1,000 stations / 18,754 vehicles** — loaded from CSV on cold start; linked to stations with capacity enforcement.
- **Pro users** — license-validated users who can rent all vehicle types (including electric); regular users are limited to non-electric bikes.
- **Payment processing** — mocked async payment service supporting charges, receipts, and refunds tied to a user's stored payment token.
- **Vehicle degradation** — report a vehicle as degraded only during an active ride; ride ends fee-free, vehicle moves to a degraded pool.
- **Maintenance pipeline** — batch treatment of eligible vehicles (7+ rides since last treatment or degraded), with type-specific treatments (chain lubrication, battery inspection, firmware update, etc.).
- **Concurrency safety** — async locks per station and per user to prevent double-booking, station overflow, and duplicate ride starts.
- **State persistence** — full application state serialized to JSON on shutdown and restored on startup (atomic writes via temp file + rename).

## Running the Project

This repository now contains only the backend API.

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.12+, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

---

### 1. Run the backend (API)

From the **project root**:

```bash
cd advanced-programming-project
```

Create and activate a virtual environment with `uv`:

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
```

On Windows: `.venv\Scripts\activate`

Install backend dependencies and start the API server:

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
uvicorn tlvflow.api.app:app --reload
```

The API will be at **http://localhost:8000**.

- **Swagger UI:** http://localhost:8000/docs  
- **ReDoc:** http://localhost:8000/redoc  

On first launch, the server loads vehicles and stations from `data/`. On later runs it restores state from `data/state.json` if present.

| POST   | `/ride/start-by-vehicle`             | Start a ride by vehicle ID (body `{ user_id, vehicle_id }`); vehicle must be at a station; enforces user-type permissions via `can_rent()` |

All request/response bodies are validated with Pydantic (`extra="forbid"` rejects unknown fields).

## Vehicle Selection Logic

When a ride starts, the system finds the nearest station (by Euclidean distance) that has an eligible vehicle. A vehicle is eligible to rent if:

- `status == AVAILABLE`
- `rides_since_last_treated <= 10` (so 10 rides is still rentable; it becomes unrentable after the 11th)

User-type permissions (`can_rent()`) are enforced only in the `/ride/start-by-vehicle` flow — regular users are blocked from renting electric vehicles there. The `/ride/start` and `/ride/start-by-station` flows select vehicles by station eligibility without a per-user type check.

Treatment can be initiated on vehicles with **7 or more** rides since last treatment (`rides_since_last_treated >= 7`). Unrentable vehicles (`> 10` rides) stay docked until treated.

When multiple eligible vehicles exist at a station, a **deterministic selection rule** applies:

1. Prefer **bike**, then **ebike**, then **scooter** (fixed type priority).
2. Within the same type, choose the vehicle with the **smallest `vehicle_id`** (lexicographic order).

## Running Tests

Backend tests only (run from project root):

```bash
uv run pytest
uv run pytest -v
uv run pytest tests/unit/
uv run pytest tests/integration/
```

The test suite includes **27 test files** organized into:

- **Unit tests** — domain entities, services, repositories, and loaders tested in isolation.
- **Integration tests** — full API tests using FastAPI's `TestClient` via httpx, covering users, vehicles, stations, and rides endpoints.

## Data Files

| File              | Records | Description                                                    |
|-------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `vehicles.csv`    | 18,754  | Vehicle ID, station ID, type (scooter/electric_bicycle/bicycle), status, rides since last treated, last treated date |
| `stations.csv`    | 1,000   | Station ID, name, latitude, longitude, max capacity            |
| `state.json`      | —       | Auto-generated on shutdown; contains full serialized application state |

## Design Patterns & OOP Principles

| Pattern / Principle       | Where Applied                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Abstract Base Class**   | `Vehicle` ABC with `Bike`, `EBike`, `Scooter` concrete implementations        |
| **Factory**               | `VehicleFactory.create_vehicle()` with a type registry                        |
| **Inheritance**           | `ProUser` extends `User` with license validation and expanded permissions     |
| **Polymorphism**          | `can_rent()` differs between User (non-electric only) and ProUser (all types); `get_required_treatments()` differs per vehicle type; `is_electric` property differs per subclass |
| **Encapsulation**         | Protected (`_`) and private (`__`) attributes with read-only properties throughout all domain entities |
| **Protocol (Structural Typing)** | Repository interfaces defined as `Protocol` classes for loose coupling |
| **Repository Pattern**    | Each entity has a dedicated repository with consistent `add`/`get`/`snapshot`/`restore` interface |
| **Dependency Injection**  | Services receive repositories and external services as function parameters     |
| **Async Concurrency**     | `asyncio.Lock` per station and per user to prevent race conditions            |
| **Atomic Persistence**    | State saved via temp file + `os.rename` to prevent corruption                 |

## State Persistence

The application maintains full state across restarts:

**Shutdown:** all repositories serialize their state into a single JSON snapshot saved atomically to `data/state.json`.

**Startup:** if `state.json` exists, all repositories restore from it. Vehicles are re-linked to stations, and degraded vehicles are moved to the degraded pool. If no snapshot exists (cold start), data is loaded from the CSV files.

**Snapshot keys:** `vehicles`, `stations`, `users`, `active_users`, `rides`, `maintenance`, `payments`, `degraded_vehicles`.
